# Getting Started

Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA) provides best practices in site design and customer experience with a mobile-first approach on MVC technical architecture. SFRA also provides improved extensibility, allowing merchants to build and customize their ecommerce storefronts.

## Explore the Sample App

Not a Salesforce B2C Commerce customer yet? We encourage you to review the API libraries on this site. You can also check out the code and directions for building our sample app in the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sfcc-sample-apps.>

Our storefront sample application shows how you can build amazing commerce experiences with the latest Commerce platform technologies. Although the sample application shows you a recommended approach for building a storefront, it is not a complete and fully functional storefront reference application. Some of the main differences are:

- The sample application helps developers get started proving out a clear path to successfully build a storefront using our latest technologies.
- The sample application is not a replacement for Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA). It does not have full feature parity with a reference application like SFRA.
- The sample application, unlike SFRA, is not meant to be an out of the box production storefront application. It’s meant to give you some guidance and understanding about how to get started, and it’s meant to accelerate your adoption of the new headless API.

## Join the Beta Program

Use our mocking service to try out the Commerce APIs. To test the APIs in a real application, join our Beta program. To apply, contact your Salesforce CSM (PAM for partners).
