# Update Your Order States

Use [Orders API](../orders-api-overview.md) to update different order status values:

- confirmation status
- export status
- external status
- payment status
- shipping status
- order status

For example,

- Set the order status to `new` after the order has been fraud-checked.
- Set the order status to `failed` after the payment authorization has failed.
- Set the shipping status to `shipped` once the order was sent out of the warehouse.
